## Getting Started

Using gitKraken or any git-hosting app clone the ChoreTrackerApp respitory. From there using Andriod Studios open the ChoreTrackerApp to see all the current files that are already programmed. 

### Prerequisites

Andriod Studio:
download from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio)

### Installing
First open Gitkraken and select the _clone repo_ option and using the url from the ChoreTrackerRepo input that into the box: 
Once the repo is successfully cloned then there should be a folder with all the files in the repo. The next step is to open Andriod Studio and from there select _File_ located in the upper area of the screen and then _Open_, this is where you select on the _ChoreTrackerApp_ and then _app_, select open and from there the project should be able to open with all of the programs already made. Under the _app_ folder, the _Java_ folder contains all the Java files that correlate to the XML files; under the _res > layout_ folder is where the XML files should be located. 


## Running the tests
